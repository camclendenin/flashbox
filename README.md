flashbox
========

A super easy way to display custom status updates w/o Alert Views. 


## Usage

- Add the Flashbox folder to your project 
- Import **Spinner.h** in any class in which you need flashboxes 
 
 
To create a flashbox:

```objc
  [Flashbox flashMessage:@"Foo"];
```

A nice animated alert will appear on screen with your message and then
fade away without a trace.
